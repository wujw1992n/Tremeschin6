Windows:
    Good luck

Linux:

    There are two paths you can follow:

    1. Compile natively to Linux:

        Packages you must have (as for pacman or equivalent):

            - opencv (version 4)
            - vtk
            - hdf5
            - cmake
            - make
            - gcc (a compiler, g++ preferred)

        Then just run compile_d2xcpp_linux.sh
    

    2. Cross compile to Windows:

        Packages you must* have (as for pacman or equivalent)
            - mingw-w64-binutils
            - mingw-w64-cmake
            - mingw-w64-configure
            - mingw-w64-crt
            - mingw-w64-eigen
            - mingw-w64-environment
            - mingw-w64-gcc
            - mingw-w64-giflib
            - mingw-w64-headers
            - mingw-w64-libjpeg-turbo
            - mingw-w64-libpng
            - mingw-w64-libtiff
            - mingw-w64-libwebp
            - mingw-w64-make
            - mingw-w64-openblas-lapack
            - mingw-w64-opencv
            - mingw-w64-pkg-config
            - mingw-w64-winpthreads
            - mingw-w64-xz
            - mingw-w64-zlib
            - git

            * Not sure if everything, that is what I had


        First run this: build_opencv_mingw.sh

        It'll download the source of opencv and compile it with mingw

        Takes some time, be patiet!!

        Then run compile_d2xcpp_windows.sh

        And that should be it
