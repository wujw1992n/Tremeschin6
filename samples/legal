This file may not be necessary at all, nonetheless it's a disclaimer (if needed) to explain why we pack these two demo samples on Dandere2x project.


The file "yn_moving.mkv" is taken from the movie Your Name (Kimi no na wa), only 10 seconds long, 240 frames.

It doesn't resemble the full movie experience and don't spoil anything from the story.

"yn_moving_480.mkv" is just "yn_moving.mkv" downscaled to 480p.


Those files are just for quick testing to make sure Dandere2x works.


Please, if any copyright infringement happens let us know and we'll remove these.
